# ADetailer Neo
The good ol' [ADetailer](https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer) extension, which performs automatic masking and inpainting, completely rewritten for [Forge Neo](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic/tree/neo), now ***lighter, faster, and prettier*** :tm:

- **Download ZIP:** `68 KB` &rarr; `38 KB`

> [!Caution]
> If you have installed **any** other version of `ADetailer` before, please review the **Settings** and **UI Defaults** related to `Adetailer`, as some older values are incompatible<br>
> *(or just delete `config.json` and `ui-config.json` to reset **everything**)*

## Features
After a generation, use **YOLO** or **MediaPipe** model(s) to detect certain regions *(**e.g.** face)* to perform **Inpainting**, improving fine details automatically

> [!Note]
> Not taking feature requests ; this repo is only meant as the "official" fork that is guaranteed to work with **Forge Neo** ; if you need other features, consider [this fork](https://github.com/abzaloff/aadetailer-neoforge) instead

## Models
On a fresh launch, this Extension will download the following **10** detector models into the `models/adetailer/` folder

> [!Tip]

> [!Important]
> The **YOLO** models must be in `.pt` format
